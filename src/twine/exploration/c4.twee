<<map 'c4'>><</map>>\
Route 002 connects the Great River Road and Cascade Village. To the East, you can see the road get wider and more well-traveled.

A bored looking Mergimal trainer eyes you with a yawn. Next to them, you can see a stretch of climbable rocks that lead up the cliff face. There is a small cave on an outcrop of rocks.

A small pathway leads South into the forest. Maybe it’s a shortcut to Littlemoose?

You can tell this long grass is full of Mergimals. You just need to see which ones you can find!

Roll ATTENTION x EMPATHY

<img class='trainer-image' src='jessie.png' />

There is a Mergimal Trainer standing near the base of the cliff. They yawn and roll their eyes as you approach. 'I suppose you want to have a contest?'

[[Absolutely!->404]]

:: 932 [worksheet]
Parts of this cliff seem worn off into handholds. You can attempt to climb up it if you'd like. A small cave is visible about halfway up. It might be worth checking out.

Do Worksheet 13.4.

[[We scaled the cliff!: Read 687.->c3]]
[[Explore the cave: Read 345.->345]]

:: 345 [reward]
This cave isn't very deep, but it was worth the climb! You find a few batteries in an old bird's nest. There's also a single challenge coin.
