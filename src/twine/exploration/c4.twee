Route 002 connects the Great River Road and Cascade Village. To the East, you can see the road get wider and more well-traveled.

A bored looking Mergimal trainer eyes you with a yawn. Next to them, you can see a stretch of climbable rocks that lead up the cliff face. There is a small cave on an outcrop of rocks.

A small pathway leads South into the forest. Maybe itâ€™s a shortcut to Littlemoose?

You can tell this long grass is full of Mergimals. You just need to see which ones you can find!

There is a Mergimal Trainer standing near the base of the cliff. They yawn and roll their eyes as you approach. "I suppose you want to have a contest?"

[[Absolutely!|404]]

You're looking around in the grass and bump into a prickly bush. Surprisingly, it starts to move. That's no bush: that's a Mergimal!
